# BFS and Tree graphical representation

This project is a Tkinter canvas representation of the BFS algorithm.

## Installation 

The project uses tkinter and python3. Install both and then:

- `python3 Main.py`

## Usage

- **right click**: create vertex
- **left click on a pair of vertexes**: bind them
- **middle click on vertex**: delete it

## Expanding the lib

Check the PDF included on the repo for knowing how to expand the ComponentHandler to include more components, or the GraphUtils to make an algorithm process and communicate with the canvas.
